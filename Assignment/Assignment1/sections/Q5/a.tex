It is not guaranteed that there will be a feasible solution to a Mixed
Dimensioning/Allocation Problem with Bounded Link Capacities. Because multiple
paths can have demands on the same links, the path flow variables are coupled.
If none of the link load values are equal to the link capacity values, a feasible
solution can be found. The shortest path allocation rule is used for
uncapacitated problems, i.e. problems where the demands do not ``compete'' for a
resource, in this case, the link. Therefore the Shortest Path Allocation Rule
does not apply to this problem.
