Removing the capacity constraints, as with Question 4, would result in the same
outcome, with demand $h_3$ being bifurcated for an optimal solution. However,
there are solutions available in this situation which do not require this demand
to be split across links, such as by passing all of demand $h_3$ over path
$P_{3,2}$ or path $P_{1}$
