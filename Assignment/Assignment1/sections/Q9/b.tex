It is assumed that each demand is routed as a ``group of unsplitable channels''.
Therefore the demand volume, which is given as the number of light-path
connections, enforces that all light paths of a connection follow the same path.
Allowing demands to be split across multiple oaths/wavelengths can help to avoid
wavelength contention, allowing for more efficient use of existing connections
within the network, without requiring new connections to be set up for every new
connection request.
