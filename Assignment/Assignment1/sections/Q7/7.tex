The minimum value for the objective function obtained via this code is 127. The
demand is divided as follows:

\begin{align*}
	x_{1,1} &= 11 \\
	x_{1,2} &= 6 \\
	x_{2,1} &= 9 \\
	x_{2,2} &= 8 \\
	x_{3,1} &= 6 \\
	x_{3,2} &= 6
.\end{align*}

As can be seen from these path flow variables, there are no non-zero flows with
less than 6 demand volume units.
