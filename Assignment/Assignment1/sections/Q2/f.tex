Increasing the value of $\hat{h}_{1,2}$ to 15 would result in an infeasible
problem. While the capacity is available on link 3 for this increase in demand,
there is no availability for the increase on link 2. The available link capacity
remaining on $c_3$ is 1 DVU, which is the required amount for the increase in
demand, however there is 0 availability on the link $e=2$.
